PROMPT 1:
Understanding the project structure and technology stack

I'm a junior developer who just joined this project. I've read the README but still need help understanding the project structure and technology stack.

Here's my current understanding of the project:

- It seems to be a [your best guess at what the application does]

- It appears to use [technologies/frameworks you've identified]

- The folder structure seems to follow [pattern you've observed]

Project structure:

[Paste concise directory structure - limit to top-level folders and key subfolders]

Key configuration files:

[Paste relevant sections from package.json/pom.xml/requirements.txt/Gemfile, docker files, etc.]

Could you:

1. Validate my understanding and correct any misconceptions

2. Identify additional key technologies, frameworks, and libraries used

3. Explain what each main folder likely contains and its purpose

4. Point out where the application entry points are located

5. Suggest 3-5 specific questions I should ask my team to deepen my understanding

I'm particularly confused about [mention specific areas of confusion, if any].

After your explanation, could you suggest a small exploration exercise I could do to verify my understanding of the project structure?

Practical application of the prompt 
Use when you understand the basic setup but need deeper insight into the project structure
Test your initial assumptions and correct any misconceptions early
Helps identify the technologies you might need to learn more about
Provides context on code organization to navigate the project more effectively
Gives you specific questions to ask your team that will demonstrate engagement
